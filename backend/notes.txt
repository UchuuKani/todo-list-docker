Plan is:
- get frontend and backend working in development with docker compose
- once working in dev, create a trial account in azure and create a vm to run docker and nginx
- have nginx serve the static frontend files, and proxy requests from front end to back end
- after nginx is set up and frontend can hit back end endpoints, set up a jenkins server? Use docker here too?
- after this, need to look into provisioning infra with terraform, and configure provisioned infra with either ansible or puppet?
